     <p>Delhi has a long and fascinating history that dates back to ancient times. The city has been inhabited since the 6th century BC and has been ruled by several powerful empires, including the Maurya, Gupta, and Mughal dynasties. It was also the capital of the British Raj in India before the country gained independence in 1947. The city’s history can be seen in its many ancient monuments, forts, and palaces, which are spread throughout the city.</p>

     <h1>Economy and Modern Industry</h1>

     <p>The economy of Delhi is one of the largest and most robust among all states and Union Territories in India, acting as the largest commercial center in Northern India. It is overwhelmingly dominated by the tertiary (services) sector, which contributes approximately 85% of its Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP), with key industries including Information Technology (IT), telecommunications, banking, media, and real estate. The city’s strategic location, massive consumer market, and high GDP per capita attract both domestic and foreign investment. While not a manufacturing powerhouse like some other states, Delhi and its satellite cities (part of the National Capital Region or NCR) form a critical industrial and logistical hub, supporting a vast ecosystem of small and large businesses, transportation networks (like the Delhi Metro), and administrative services.</p>

     <h1>Culture and Cuisine</h1>

     <p>Delhi is a dynamic melting pot of diverse traditions, a consequence of centuries of migration and rule by various cultural groups, particularly the Mughals and Punjabis. This cosmopolitan character is most famously reflected in its world-renowned cuisine, often considered the culinary capital of North India. The narrow lanes of Old Delhi are famous for street food like spicy chaat and sugary jalebis, while the city is the birthplace of global delicacies such as Butter Chicken (Murg Makhani) and a hub for rich Mughlai fare like kebabs and biryanis. From Sufi shrines and grand festivals like Diwali and Eid to its vast array of museums, contemporary art galleries, and vibrant theatre scene, Delhi's culture is a captivating blend of ancient heritage and modern, metropolitan energy.</p>
